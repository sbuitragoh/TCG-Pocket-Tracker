# TCG Pocket Tracker

Simple project to track the collection inside TCG Pocket.
Works with:
- A3. Celestial Guardians

## Roadmap

- Implement new sets.
- If possible, get a profile account so you could have all your inventory in one place.
- Improving the GUI (fixing sizes, dark mode, etc...)

### Done
- Getting to plot images and plot them in black and white if it's unchecked.
- Tabs working properly.
- Refined the probability function.
