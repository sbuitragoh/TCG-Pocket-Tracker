# TCG Pocket Tracker

Simple project to track the collection inside TCG Pocket.
Right now it only works for A3 set (Celestial Guardians) but it's desirable to import another sets via JSON files.

## Roadmap

- Tabs working correctly. At the moment you could only check cards in the 'All Inventory' tab.
- Implement new sets
- Images of the different cards when selected (if it's possible, turning them grey if you don't have them)
- If possible, get a profile account so you could have all your inventory in one place
